			<h2>History</h2>
		</header>
		<article>
			<p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum continued as Python's lead developer until July 12, 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January, 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.
			</p>
			<p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.
			</p>
			<p>Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6x and 2.7x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.

			<h2>Features</h2>
		</header>
		<article>
			<p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.<br>Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.<br>Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has<code>filter, map and reduce</code>functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
		</header>
		<article>
			<p>Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.
			</p>
			<h3 id="sub_indentation">Indentation</h3>
			<p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure. This feature is also sometimes termed the off-side rule. The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean. This results into Python programs that look similar and consistent.</p>
			<h3 id="sub_statements">Statements</h3>
			<ul id="list_code">
				<li><code>assigment (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>if (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>for (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>while (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>try (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>raise (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>class (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>def (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>with (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>pass (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>assert (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>yield (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>import (statement)</code></li>
				<li><code>print (statement)</code></li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="sub_methods">Methods</h3>
			<p>Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax<code>instance.method(argument)</code>is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for <code>class.method(instance, argument)</code>Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).</p>
			<h3 id="sub_typing">Typing</h3>
			<p>Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.</p>
			<p>Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example,<code>SpamClass()</code>or<code>EggsClass()</code>and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.</p>
			<h3 id="sub_mathematics">Mathematics</h3>
			<p>Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and the remainder operator % (where the remainder can be negative) <code>4%-3 == -2</code> It also has ** for exponentiation as in the C language <code>5**3 == 125</code> and <code>9**0.5 == 3.0</code> A new matrix multiply @ operator is included in version 3.5 I.e. all these operators work as in traditional math; with same precedence rules, the operators infix (or - can additionally be unary). Additionally, it has a unary operator (~), which essentially inverts all the bits of its one argument. For integers, this means <code>~x=-x-1</code> Other operators include bitwise shift operators: <code>x << y</code>which shifts x to the left y places, <code>x*(2**y)</code>and <code>x >> y</code>which shifts x to the right y places, the same as <code>x//(2**y)</code></p>

			<p>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>
			<p>Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites (if supplied). However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.</p>
			<p>As of March 2018, the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 130,000 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Graphical user interfaces</li>
				<li>Web frameworks</li>
				<li>Multimedia</li>
				<li>Databases</li>
				<li>Networking</li>
				<li>Test frameworks</li>
				<li>Automation</li>
				<li>Web scraping</li>
				<li>Documentation</li>
				<li>System administration</li>
				<li>Scientific computing</li>
				<li>Text processing</li>
